    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><b>Cranberry Muffins</b></p>These cranberry muffins are moist and tangy with a slight citrus accent, thanks to orange zest and orange juice. Fresh cranberries are naturally tart so if you prefer a sweeter muffin, add more sugar or used dried cranberries.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion (chopped)</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>500g (1 lb) ground beef or sausage</li>
        <li>1 can (400g / 14 oz) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
       
      
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
         <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners.</li>
        <li>Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat sugar and vegetable oil in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light in color and well blended, about 3 minutes. Add egg and beat until smooth. Mix in orange juice and zest.</li>
        <li>Add flour mixture in batches, stirring until just combined. Fold in cranberries.</li>
        <li>Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops until tops are golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool muffins in the pan briefly before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
